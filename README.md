# final_project_2023
My target for this project is to ask the user to choose a song out of a list of songs(only multiple songs), then the code prints out what album the song is from, and plays 5 seconds of the song using an mp3 player. 
What will your code do? - Include descriptions and/or sketches and/or a mockup of what you want your code to produce.

What the terminal code will most-likely look like:

Hello! Here are a list of songs: [Cruel Summer, Look What You Made Me Do, Style, Karma, Bad Blood, Lover]. Pick one and I will give you the album the song is on and I will also play it!

(user picks one): Cruel Summer

Cruel Summer is on the Lover Album. *plays song*
