# final_project_2023
My target for this project is to ask the user to choose a song out of a list of songs(only multiple songs), then the code prints out what album the song is from, and plays 5 seconds of the song using an mp3 player. 
What will the user need to do before running the code?

The user will need to install the mpg123 ports, using this link: https://ports.macports.org/port/mpg123/. Before then, the user might also need to install Macports, using this link: https://www.macports.org/install.php. Depending on your Mac version, or Andriod, you might have to install the systems differently, but it's easy to follow by reading the websites instructions which differs depending on different computers!

What the terminal code will most-likely look like:

Hello! Here are a list of songs: [Cruel Summer, Look What You Made Me Do, Style, Karma, Bad Blood, Lover]. Pick one and I will give you the album the song is on and I will also play it!

(user picks one): Cruel Summer

Cruel Summer is on the Lover Album. *plays song*
